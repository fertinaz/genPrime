# genPrime

This small piece of code detects prime numbers in a given range. 
```
$ genPrime --range=20,40 --algorithm=1 
Elapsed time: 3.868Âµs for range: [20,40] using algorithm: 1 
List of prime numbers: [23 29 31 37] 
```

## Compile and install 
Assuming that you have successfully installed `GO` in your environment:
```
$ go install
```
This command compiles the source code, and puts the binary executable under `$GOPATH/bin`. If `$GOPATH/bin` is added to your `$PATH`, then you should 
be able to run the command below successfully:
```
$ genPrime --help
```
Alternatively you can try this command as well, but it is sloppy and error prone:
```
go run genPrime.go parseFlags.go basic.go eratosthenes.go sse.go validate.go --range=1,100 --algorithm=1
```

## Run
Sample usage:
```
genPrime --range=10,200 \
  --algorithm=1    \
  --print=true     \
  --validate=true  \
  --parallel=false
```
This execution uses the first algorithm to find the prime numbers between 
the range between 10 and 200. It'll print the results as a list, and 
validate them as well. Parallel execution is disabled.

Note:
--parallel option doesn't work properly, so please ignore it at the moment.

## Tests
Additionally, to run some simple tests:
```
go test -v
```
